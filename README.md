### 🎉 Why Build This?
Because… why not? It’s fun, nerdy, and an awesome way to learn hardware interfacing, automate games...

### 📦 Future Ideas
1. Add a score display with an LCD screen 📟
2. Use a camera instead of an LDR for advanced AI dino vision 🎯

reminder for myself to test irl and upload a video of this in action
